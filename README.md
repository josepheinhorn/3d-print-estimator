> **The Problem:** 3D printing prototypes for game merch or physical assets can get expensive if you aren't tracking filament costs and print time.
> **The Solution:** A precision calculator designed to estimate material costs and time efficiency, specifically optimized for workflows using the Adventurer 5M Pro.

### ⚡ Key Features
* **Cost Analysis:** Input filament price and weight to get the exact cost of every gram used in your print.
* **Efficiency Scoring:** Calculates a "value score" based on print time vs. material cost to help you optimize your slicer settings.
* **Local Logging:** Save your print estimates to a local JSON file on your Mac to track your prototyping budget over time.
* **Dev Terminal UI:** Styled with our signature neon-pixel aesthetic and featuring a custom CSS "nozzle" animation.

### 📖 How to Use
1. Open the [Live Demo](https://josepheinhorn.github.io/3d-print-estimator/).
2. Enter the data from your slicer (Filament weight, price, and estimated hours).
3. Review the total cost breakdown.
4. Click **"Save Log"** to keep a record of your build progress.
